                I am always excited whenever I have the opportunity to dive into 
                a new programming language or framework. My career clearly shows 
                my enthusiasm for learning and development: I started with mobile 
                development and discovered my passion for programming. Right after 
                my IHK certification, I focused on learning the next programming 
                language to broaden my horizon. I particularly enjoy delving into 
                complex topics and approaching them in a solution-oriented and 
                structured way. My ability to quickly familiarize myself with new 
                technologies and my drive for continuous improvement make me a 
                versatile and reliable employee. At the same time, I enjoy working 
                in teams, contributing ideas, and being inspired by the experiences 
                of others. Now, I am thrilled to return to professional life, apply 
                my newly acquired knowledge, and actively contribute to the success 
                of your company.
